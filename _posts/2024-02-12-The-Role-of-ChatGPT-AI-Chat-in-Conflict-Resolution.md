In an age where technology is interwoven with every aspect of our lives, it's no surprise that it's also revolutionizing the way we handle disputes. Enter the realm of artificial intelligence (AI) and its potential in conflict resolution. The ChatGPT AI Chat iOS app stands at the forefront of this transformation, promising a new approach to mediating and resolving conflicts. In this article, we'll explore the ChatGPT AI Chat app's potential uses in conflict resolution and how it could change the game.
